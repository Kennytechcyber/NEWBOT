Example : with mention                  => .welcome Hi `mention` welcome to * Group.
Example : with mention and button       => .welcome Hi `mention` welcome to * Group. `button/I'm fine` `button/I'm ok` `button/Not Bad` `header/How are you?`
Example : with button                   => .welcome Hi welcome to * Group `button/I'm fine` `button/I'm ok` `button/Not Bad` `header/How are you?`

#size // last joined member count or total size of group when joined
#desc // group description
#onwer // group owner
#name // group name
                                        => .welcome Hi `mention`, welcome to #name

Of Course you can combine all this together, like button #blah mention ...
